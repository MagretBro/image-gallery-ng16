# ImgGallery

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 16.2.14. It contains an up-to-date script for Angular 16 that implements a responsive image slider on your website.

# Features
+ Responsive Image Slider: Displays a large image from the gallery with a thumbnail strip underneath.
+ Thumbnail Navigation: Clickable thumbnails to change the main displayed image.
+ Adaptive Design: Thumbnails adapt to the screen size. On mobile, thumbnails are hidden, and swipe navigation is enabled on the main image.
+ Navigation Controls: When there are more than 5 thumbnails, left and right navigation buttons are provided to scroll through the thumbnails.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
